# CBRAIN-GAN
GAN-based approach for climate models

Environment variables such as 
- Temperature (TBP)
- Humidity (QBP)
- Surface Pressure (PS)
- Solar Insolation (SOLIN)
- Sensible Heat Flux (SHFLX)
- Latent Heat FLux (LHFLX)

are used to generate a distribution of Precipitation (PRECT) and learn its relation with the above variables.
